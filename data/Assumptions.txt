Assumptions

add-arc-boundary m1 m2 x0 y0 x1 y1 galph th0 th1 n

m1, m2 : Regions on either side of boundary
x0, y0, x1, y1 : Fragment of the arch
x0 shift up, x0 shift right, x1 shift down, y1 shift left, 

galph : ??
th0 : start angle of drewing (ex: a circle will start from 0)
th1 : end angle of drewing (ex: a circle will end at 360)
n : Number of points in each fragment in the arc

-- diffrent between a and b will make the shape of boundary dots more like an ellipse than a circle
