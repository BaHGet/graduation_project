SOLUTION OF SCHRODINGER'S EQUATION IN 2D USING THE BOUNDARY ELEMENT METHOD
=============================================================================

This program allows one to calculate densities of states and photoemiession
intensities for electrons confined to a plane and bound by barriers within
regions of potential and effective mass that can be defined by the user
as needed. This program is well suited to deal with surface states in
surfaces like Cu(111), Au(111), etc. decorated with steps, molecules,
adatoms, etc., and with electrons in 2D in general. It can also find
application in solving Maxwell's equations in a 2D geometry (with
translational invariance along the z direction) for E polarization along z.

The source code is self-contained and it can be compiled with the command

             g++ -O3 ebem.cpp -o ebem

using gnu C++ compiler to generate the executable file ebem. The source code
is standard C++, so it can be compiled with any standard C++ compiler.
